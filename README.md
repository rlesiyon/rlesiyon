# Projects: 

### <a href="https://github.com/rlesiyon/youtube_scrapping">Youtube scrapping</a>

This project implements a method for scrapping youtube search result using selenium. Selenium is a perform document that allows for automation of website by the use of webdriver.

#### skills learned
+ ***Selenium:*** 

    Automating website scrolling to get a large source html to parse. The html page is parse using ```XPATH```. We first inspected the html source page and got the respective xpath for a video renderer. We then use the corresponding xpath to find the videoId for the youtube video.

+ ***Youtube Data api:*** 
 
  To get the video statistics and video description, we used Youtube Data Api to access each video. 

+ ***Hydra:*** 

  We define the project configuration using **hydra**. With hydra we can store file path with credentials and website headers, root url and country of search in yaml file.
