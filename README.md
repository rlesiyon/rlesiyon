    Automating website scrolling to get a large source html to parse. The html page is parse using ```XPATH```. We first inspected the html source page and got the respective xpath for a video renderer. We then use the corresponding xpath to find the videoId for the youtube video.

  To get the video statistics and video description, we used Youtube Data Api to access each video.

  We define the project configuration using **hydra**. With hydra we can store file path with credentials and website headers, root url and country of search in yaml file.
